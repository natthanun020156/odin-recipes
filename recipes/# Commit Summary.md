## update recipes add file css style in all page (0df5803)

Add shared CSS styles to all recipe pages
The update introduces a centralized stylesheet to standardize the appearance of all recipe pages, improving design consistency and maintainability.

### Changes
- Added a new CSS file (`css/stlyesheet.css`) with styles for body, images, paragraphs, list items, and specific elements like `.title`, `#Home`, and `.backgroundcontent`.
- Linked the new stylesheet in `index.html` and all recipe pages (`LavashPizza.html`, `Pan_Seared_Tilapia.html`, `Smoky_Grilled_Pork_Chops.html`).
- Updated recipe pages to use new CSS classes (`.title`, `#Home`, `.backgroundcontent`) for consistent styling.

### Impact
- Behavioral changes: Improved and consistent styling for all pages, including centralized layout and visual enhancements (e.g., text alignment, margins, and colors).
- Dependencies affected: All pages now depend on the `css/stlyesheet.css` file for their styling.
- No breaking changes identified.
- Potential performance improvement due to reuse of a shared stylesheet.
